## About:
Quick set up with easy-to-follow documentation and a great number of native features makes it one of the most powerful wrappers built on top of Jasonelle. The best part is that it's open source, so you have full control to build in features at any stage.

## Why are we building this?

Being a part of a no-code venture studio, we have built dozens of apps using [bubble.io](http://bubble.io/) in the last few years.

We have had to rely on wrappers available in the market to convert our web apps into native Android and iOS apps. These external solutions are great for one-time use but it is not possible to build in additional features yourself and the customer support is nonexistent given most wrappers are built by solopreneurs.

Thus, building our own wrapper on top of jasonelle with the native functionalities that are important to us gave us flexibility and speed. With this we didnâ€™t have to wait 1-2 weeks for a reply, where we were often told that the feature we required could not be incorporated. Plus, this way, we got full control of our wrapper to make required changes whenever we wanted.
